A subreddit for the discussion, identification, and appreciation of symbols… It has been asserted that Ovid and Vergil referred to Sirius in their Latrator Anubis, representing a jackal, or dog-headed Egyptian divinity, guardian of the visible horizon and of the solstices, transferred to Rome as goddess of the chase; but it is very doubtful whether they had in mind either star or constellation...In Chrysococca’s Tables the title is Siaer Iamane; and Doctor C. Edward Sachau’s translation of Al Biruni’s Chronology renders it Sirius Jemenicus. Riccioli had Halabor, which the 1515 Almagest applied to the constellation; and English writer on globes John Chilmead (circa 1639), Gabbar, Ecber, and Habor; while Shaari lobur, another {Page 122} queerly corrupted form, is found in Eber’s EgyptianPrincess. Aratos’ term poikilos, applied to the Dog (constellaton), is equally appropriate to Sirius now in the sense of many-colored or changeful, and is an admirable characterization, as one realizes when watching this magnificent object coming up from the horizon on a winter evening. Influences: Ptolemy states that the stars of this constellation, with the exception of Sirius, are like Venus. It is said to give good qualities, charity and a faithful heart, but violent and dangerous passions. There is some danger from, or fear of, darkness and the night, and liability to dog bites, though the latter characteristic is probably associated more particularly with Sirius. The Roman farmers sacrificed to it a fawn-colored dog at their three festivals when, in May, the sun began to approach Sirius. These, instituted 238 B.C., were the Robigalia, to secure the propitious influence of their goddess Robigo in averting rust and mildew from their fields; and the Floralia and Vinalia, to ensure the maturity of their blooming flowers, fruits and grapes. Among the Latins it naturally shared the constellation’s titles, probably originated them; and occasionally was even Canicula; indeed, as late as 1420 the Palladium of Husbandry urged certain farm-work to be done “Er the caniculere, the hounde ascende” and, more than a century later, Eden, in the Historic of the Vyage to Moscovie and Cathay, wrote: “Serius is otherwise called Canicula, this is the dogge, of whom the canicular days have their name.” February is perfect for both Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere observers to view the brightest star in the sky: Sirius. As part of the constellation Canis Major the Greater Dog, Sirius also earns the nickname of the Dog Star.

As part of the constellation Canis Major the Greater Dog, Sirius also earns the nickname of the Dog Star. From the Northern Hemisphere, Sirius arcs across in the southern sky. As part of the constellation Canis Major the Greater Dog, Sirius also earns the nickname of the Dog Star. From the Northern Hemisphere, Sirius arcs across in the southern sky. From the Southern Hemisphere, it swings high overhead. It’s always easy to spot as the brightest point of light in its region of sky (unless a planet happens to be near it, which none are in early 2024). Sirius is always easy to find. It’s the sky’s brightest star! Plus, anyone familiar with the constellation Orion can simply draw a line through Orion’s Belt to find this star. Sirius is roughly eight times as far from the Belt as the Belt is wide. Sirius is well known as the Dog Star, because it’s the chief star in the constellation Canis Major the Greater Dog. Have you ever heard anyone speak of the dog days of summer? Sirius is behind the sun as seen from Earth in Northern Hemisphere summer. In late summer, it appears in the east before sunrise, near the sun in our sky. Sirius (The Dog Star) is the brightest star in the night sky, attributed to its luminosity and proximity at a distance of 8.6 light-years.This constellation includes many popular deep-sky objects including: ... NGC 2359 (i.e. Thor’s Helmet) ... Sirius also forms the Winter Hexagon (or Winter Circle) asterism, which appears prominently in the northern sky between December and March and is also part of the Winter Triangle. According to NASA, Sirius’ mass is two times greater than the Earth’s sun and if placed next to the sun would outshine it by more than 20 times.  · Visual magnitude: -1.46 making it the brightest star in the night sky · Type: Binary star system including a main-sequence star and white dwarf star · Location: constellation Canis Major (i.e. the Dog Star) Type: Binary star system including a main-sequence star and white dwarf star · Location: constellation Canis Major (i.e. the Dog Star) ... Distance: 8.6 light-years (only twice the distance of the nearest known star system beyond the Sun, the Alpha Centauri system) All stars can appear to be twinkling or flicker as they shine through the Earth’s atmosphere with varying density, turbulent air, and particles. Sirius appears to twinkle/flicker more than other stars as it’s brightness exaggerates these atmospheric effects. Canis Major contains the following ten named stars: Adhara, Aludra, Amadioha, Atakoraka, Furud, Mirzam, Muliphein, Sirius, Unurgunite, and Wezen · This constellation includes many popular deep-sky objects including: Sirius, or Alpha Canis Major, is the brightest star in the sky and inspires wonder among stargazers. Learn how Sirius influenced ancient Egypt, as a symbol of natural cycles and femininity.Sirius has an apparent magnitude of -1.46. By comparison, the second brightest star in the sky is Canopus, appearing in the constellation Centaurus. Canopus’ apparent magnitude is -.72, roughly half as bright as Sirius. Sirius is 40 times brighter than our sun and is only 8.6 light years away, making it a close neighbor. Sirius is part of the constellation known as Canis Major, or the Big Dog. Interestingly enough, the constellation and star have been associated with dogs and wolves in many cultures all over the world. There are numerous reasons why this could be, but the most obvious is that Sirius seems to be following a great giant in the sky, Orion. The ancient Egyptians often associated Sirius with the goddess Isis, especially in its capacity as a signal that the Nile flood was on the way. The star could also be connected to Osiris, as well as Anubis and the goddess of Sirius, Sopdet, whose name means “she who is sharp.” She brought fertility to the soil and was the consort of the entity known as Sah, the constellation Orion. Although Sirius is visible for much of the year, my favorite time to view it and the spectacular constellations that surround it is from January to March. There’s nothing like going out on an icy, winter’s night and seeing the magnificent play, the celestial drama that takes place in the sky every night unfold, as it has for millennia. Whether viewed as Osiris, Orion, Isis, a wolf, or proof of interstellar travel, Sirius fills humanity with wonder.']\n"
